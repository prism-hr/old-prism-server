/**
 * This is a custom task executor implementation suitable for our needs. The specific feature are:<ol>
 * <li>Tasks execute sequentially (FIFO queue).</li>
 * <li>Each task is executed by a new thread, created just for executing this task.
 * <li>The executor has soft  pausing/resuming feature. "Soft" means that calling pause() stops just after finishing currently executing task and before taking the next one
 * (of course paused executor can still collect tasks to be done later).</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 *
 * Above semantics allows executing tasks that access database via Spring/Hibernate cooperation and sessionFactory.getCurrentSession() pattern.
 * This is because hibernate sessions are being coupled with java threads.
 *
 * <b>Implementation remarks:</b><p/>
 * 1. Please observe that although the executor runs tasks sequentially, we need fully concurrent-aware implementation because
 * the executor instance is being accessed concurrently by:<ul>
 *     <li>client threads that are submitting tasks for execution (i.e. calling execute() method)</li>
 *     <li>client threads that are controlling the executor (pause(), resume(), shutdown())</li>
 *     <li>worker threads that are executing tasks (actually we ensure that there is always at most one such thread)</li>
 *     <li>the Queue Consumer thread</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * 2. Both "queue consumer thread" and "queueWe run all threads issued inside implementation with background priority (Thread.MIN_PRIORITY).
