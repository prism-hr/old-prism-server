${ACTION_CONTROL}

<p>
    We kindly ask our Referees to submit their feedback using our linked admissions portal, (rather than submitting
    via other means), to keep our reminders accurate and to help us authenticate and accurately merge the feedback
    we receive.
</p>

<p>
    The timely collection of references is crucial for us to consider our applicants, therefore
    we send periodic email reminders where we do not receive a response.
</p>

<p>
    Thank you in advance for your time.
</p>

<p>
    We look forward to receiving your feedback at your earliest convenience. Should you run into any difficulty, please
