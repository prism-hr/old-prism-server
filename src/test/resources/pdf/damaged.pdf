They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and, 
meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside must 
be insensible or dead. Of course the two were quite unable to do 
anything. They shouted consolation and promises, and went off back to 
the town again to get help. One can imagine them, covered with sand, 
excited and disordered, running up the little street in the bright 
sunlight just as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and 
people were opening their bedroom windows. Henderson went into the 
railway station at once, in order to telegraph the news to London. The 
newspaper articles had prepared men's minds for the reception of the 
idea. I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the 
huge hole in which the cylinder lay. I have already described the 
appearance of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground. The turf and 
gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion. No doubt its 
impact had caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were not there. 
I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and 
had gone away to breakfast at Henderson's house. There were four or five 
boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their feet dangling, and 
amusing themselves--until I stopped them--by throwing stones at the 
giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they began playing at 
"touch" in and out of the group of bystanders. Among these were a couple 
of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed sometimes, a girl carrying a 
baby, Gregg the butcher and his little boy, and two or three loafers and 
golf caddies who were accustomed to hang about the railway station. 
There was very little talking. Few of the common people in England had 
anything but the vaguest astronomical ideas in those days. Most of them 
were staring quietly at the big table like end of the cylinder, which 
was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had left it. I fancy the popular 
expectation of a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this 
inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was there, and other people came. 
I clambered into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my 
feet. The top had certainly ceased to rotate. It was only when I got 
thus close to it that the strangeness of this object was at all evident 
to me. At the first glance it was really no more exciting than an 
overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road. Not so much so, 
indeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It required a certain amount 
of scientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was 
no common oxide, that the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the 
crack between
