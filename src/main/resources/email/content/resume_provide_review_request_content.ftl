    Dear ${TEMPLATE_USER_FIRST_NAME},
</h1>

<p>
	I've recently created a new cv/resume template ${RESUME_CODE} on ${TEMPLATE_SYSTEM_TITLE}.
</p>
<p>
    I'd really appreciate it if you could find the time to provide me with some comments. You
    can decline the request if you wish, but I'd very much value your feedback, and I'd be happy to return the
    favour should you find my thoughts on your own approach useful at some point.
</p>

<p>
    <b>If you're happy to proceed:</b>
    <br/>
	<ul>
	    <li>Please follow the <i>Provide Review</i> link below.</li>
	    <li>
	    	Enter a password of your choice on the registration form, (or simply login if you have already
	        registered).
	    </li>
	    <li>
	    	Then follow the onscreen guidance to access a short feedback form. You can also upload a document
	    	if you find that more straighforward.
	    </li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<b>If you'd prefer to decline:</b>
	<br/>
	<ul>
	    <li>
	    	Simply click on the alternative, <i>Decline</i>, link.

    With many thanks - I look forward to receiving your thoughts,
